# 'SWOT' ANALYSIS
### Strengths
* The project uses dynamic memory allocation.
* The project uses random function and math headre file.
* use   user response to play game 
* Since the program uses math headre file and randome function,
* The Program can be easily modified. to  snake water gun gam e

### Weaknesses
* programme  may get several draw cases because of draw condition
